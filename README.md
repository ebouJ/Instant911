      Soter allows users to use their mobile device as a safety tool. 
      Users can safely walk around alone at night/in a potentially dangerous environment, 
      emboldened by the fact that they are protected. 
      Their mobile device detects certain external factors that may be associated with a dangerous situation, 
      such as triggers and potentially, 
      perceiving areas of heightened crime.
      This app is incomplete for now, I plan to complete it as soon as possible.
